                <h3>My passion for baking cakes üéÇ</h3>
                <p> I discovered my passion for desserts by running a cake laboratory with my family. <br/>
                    This experience taught me the art of taste, the art of beauty and pushed my limits to optimize as much as possible the productivity and the quality of our products. <br/>
                    I discovered that I love working with people and especially to satisfy their desires related to the taste and appearance of the cakes they order. <br/><br/>                    
                    Our motto is: "Taste gives color!" and if I made you crave sweets, I invite you to view our facebook page: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Leclairmagique" target="_blank">L‚Äô√©clair magique</a>

                <h3>My passion for reading üìò </h3>
                <p> I could say that this passion was inspired by my mother, who took care since I was a little girl, to walk with me in the wonderful land of fairy tales. <br/>
                    I love to read poems, psychotherapy novels and police adventure novels. <br/>
                    As a student, I used to wander the antique shops in Cluj-Napoca in search of rare books. <br/>
                    Among my favorite authors are:<br/> Eminescu, Irvin Yalom, Jostein Gaarder, Gary Chapman, Mihail Bulgakov and Horia Tecuceanu.

                <h3>My passion for travel üì∏‚Äç</h3>
                <p> Who doesn't like to travel?<br/>
                    But the adventure becomes more interesting when you have a friend with you to share experiences with. <br/>
                    So »òandor and I became best friends at the age of 12 and since then we've been going everywhere together. <br/>
                    If you want, I invite you to watch the video below with us on our journey. <br/>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p> This is the first site I built to learn how to use  HTML and CSS. <br/>
                    It is a site that has no content, but I applied a lot of HTML tags and stylized it with many CSS elements. <br/>

                <p> 
                    For the second project I thought of doing something useful, so I made a weather application for the capitals of Europe and for Cluj-Napoca. 
                    (For Cluj-Napoca because I like to use the work I do). <br/>
                    In this application you can observe the temperature, humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure of the selected city. <br/>
                    In the construction of this project I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. <br/>

                        <p> Georgiana and I have been friends for a long time, <br/>
                            If I were to describe her, I would say that she is cheerful, optimistic, sometimes childish, she loves nature, she likes to read and she likes hiking and trips,
                             not to mention that she makes great cakes. <br/>                           
                            I could say about her that she is ambitious, she pays attention to details, very perseverance in the work she does, 
                            sometimes stubborn because she does not accept the phrase: "let it go like this ...doesn't matter", always seeks to solve problems that arise, 
                            she is a hard worker and she likes to constantly evolve, she works well in a team because she likes people a lot. <br/>
                            I highly recommend her because between the two of us, she always takes care of me, she doesn't forget to invite me everywhere she goes and she always takes care to gather beautiful memories together.ü•Ç

                <p> I am currently a student at the University of Finance and Banking in Cluj-Napoca. <br/>
                    But recently I realized that I like this side of IT, namely web development. <br/>
                    So I started some projects to improve my skills. <br/> 
                    Let me say that I am proficient in HTML5 / CSS3 and Javascript. <br/>
                    <br/><br/>                    
                    As a person, <br/>
                    I am optimistic, persevering, ambitious and always eager to learn new things and tackle new challenges. <br/>
                    I am very passionate about web development and web design, sometimes I am stubborn because I always try to give my best to create the "perfect product".
